# Phonebook Application

This project is a simple phonebook application that allows users to store and manage their contacts. You can access the live application [here](https://phonebook-5m7o.onrender.com/).

This repository is part of my solutions for the exercises from [Full Stack Open](https://github.com/noceg43/fullstackopen-exercises).
